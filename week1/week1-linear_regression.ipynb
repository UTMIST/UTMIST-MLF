A tensor is essentially a multi-dimensional array (just like a NumPy array) that can run on GPU for accelerated computing. Unlike NumPy, PyTorch tensors also support automatic differentiation, which is crucial for machine learning. In practice, you can think of tensors as flexible containers for data – vectors, matrices, images, etc. – that PyTorch can track through computations to compute gradients for learning."

Autograd allows PyTorch to **compute gradients automatically** for any tensor operations, which is essential for model training. When we set `requires_grad=True` on a tensor, PyTorch will record all operations involving that tensor and build a computational graph. Then, by calling `.backward()`, it computes the gradient of some final result (like a loss) with respect to that tensor (and any other tensors with `requires_grad`).\n",

    "4. **Define the optimizer** – e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, etc., from `torch.optim`. You tell it which model parameters to update and the learning rate.\n",

    "## 2.6 Discussion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations – you have implemented and trained a linear regression model using two approaches! 🎉  \n",
    "This simple exercise illustrated the core ideas of machine learning training: we defined a model with parameters, chose a loss function (MSE), computed gradients, and updated the parameters to reduce the loss. This is the essence of training any machine learning model, from linear regression to deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few takeaways and things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model complexity:** Linear regression is a very simple, *linear* model. It can capture linear trends but cannot fit more complex patterns (for instance, if the true relationship is quadratic or otherwise nonlinear). Many real-world problems aren’t linear, which is why we move to more complex models (like neural networks) in later weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Over/Under-shooting:** We briefly mentioned learning rate. If your training diverged or the loss didn’t go down, the learning rate might have been too high (causing overshooting). If it was extremely slow, maybe it was too low. This hyperparameter often needs tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autograd magic:** We relied on autograd for the second part. It’s good to know that under the hood, PyTorch built a computational graph of our model and computed gradients using the chain rule, just like we did manually. For complex models, autograd is indispensable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Free Lunch:** Our final linear model didn’t fit every point exactly (due to noise). Also, real data can have outliers or non-linear patterns that linear regression won’t handle well. In practice, we consider more robust models or data preprocessing for such cases. But linear regression is still a fundamental starting point.\n"
